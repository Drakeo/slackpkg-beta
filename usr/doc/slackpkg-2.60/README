   Slackpkg is a special tool for who wants install or upgrade packages
   through network. With package tool, you can make a minimal
   installation of Slackware Linux and install other stuffs from one
   Slackware mirror.

   You don't need setup NFS, or make dozens of CDs for all your
   computers, only needs to type one command and all packages in Official
   Slackware will be in your hands.

   :---------------------------------------------------------------------

   install: First of all, you need to download the correct package. After
   download, you can install the slackpkg using the command installpkg.

   After install, you need to select ONE (and only ONE) mirror for
   download packages from. Edit your /etc/slackpkg/mirrors and uncomment
   one of that lines, or include your own mirror. To include a local mirror
   (cdrom or dir), put a line like that:

   cdrom://mnt/cdrom

   or file://mnt/cdrom... both syntax are correct.

   With the mirror selected, you type:

   # slackpkg update
   # slackpkg update gpg

   The slackpkg will download some important files and make update of all
   package lists. The second command will install Slackware's GPG key, to
   check all packages before install.

   Now you can really use slackpkg -;)

   :---------------------------------------------------------------------

   instructions: Slackpkg have many features, like search and automatic
   download and install or upgrade. To upgrade your packs, is very
   recommended run slackpkg update first.

search

   You can search in official Slackware packages, for any file in
   Slackware distribution. Do you need a strange library? Use search to
   find them.

   # slackpkg search nameoffile

   All packages with the "name" file will be show and you can see if the
   packageare installed or not. And, if not, you can download and install
   with other slackpkg commands.

install

   The instalation of one package is very easy. You only need to type:

   # slackpkg install package

   And the package will be downloaded and installed. Instead "package",
   you can use a pattern, to download and istall all packages that
   matches that pattern. Before download and install, the slackpkg show a
   list of the packages to you and ask if you really wants install that
   packages.

   # slackpkg install n/dhcp

   Will download and install dhcp and dhcpcd. You can't install an
   already installed package, for this, you need to upgrade the package.

upgrade

   Upgrade works in the same way of install. But upgrade already installed
   packages to a new version. 

   Upgrade can't install new packages, you need to install that packages
   first and after make a upgrade (or you can install the upgraded
   package and save your time).

reinstall

   Is the same of install. But works for already installed packages.
   
remove

   With remove, you can remove some installed packages. Works in the
   same way of removepkg from pkgtool.

blacklist

   Using that command, you can  "blacklist"  some  packages. Packages 
   blacklisted  can't  be  upgraded  or installed. If you want to remove  
   some  package  from the  black list, please edit /etc/slackpkg/blacklist.

download

   Only download the packages. It will be in /var/cache/packages and you
   can install/upgrade/reinstall those packages later (or burn a CD with
   them).

info

   Put on screen some informations of the package given by the command line.
   Info like: compressed and uncompressed size, description, etc...

upgrade-all

   Sync all your installed packages with slackware mirrors packages. This is
   the recommended commando to upgrade whole system. Remember to use
   install-new before upgrade-all. Nasty things can happen if you forgot
   it.

clean-system

   Remove all non-official packages. Is a good command to keep your system
   in order. It will be remove all third-party or removed from offical
   slackware packages.

install-new

   Install  packages  that  are added in slackware distribution.  Run
   this if you are upgrading all your  system  to  another  slackware
   version or if you are using current.
